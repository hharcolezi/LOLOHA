We used the following datasets:

- Syn: This is a synthetic dataset with k=360 (i.e., the number of minutes in 6 hours), n=10000 users, and 𝛕=120 data collections (i.e., 4x over 30 days). For each user, the value at the first timestamp follows a Uniform distribution. For each subsequent time, a change can occur with a probability of 0.25, with a value following a Uniform distribution too.
- Adult: This is a classical dataset from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). We only selected the ``hours-per-week" attribute. To simulate multiple data collections, we randomly permuted the data 𝛕=260 times (i.e., 52 weeks over 5-years). 
- DB_MT: This dataset is produced by the [folktables Python package](https://github.com/zykls/folktables) that provides access to datasets derived from the US Census. We selected the survey year 2018 and the "Montana" (MT) state. To simulate 𝛕=80 counter data collections, we selected all PWGTP features (i.e., PWGTP1, ..., PWGTP80).
- DB_DE: This dataset is produced by the [folktables Python package](https://github.com/zykls/folktables) that provides access to datasets derived from the US Census. We selected the survey year 2018 and the "Delaware" (DE) state. To simulate 𝛕=80 counter data collections, we selected all PWGTP features (i.e., PWGTP1, ..., PWGTP80).
